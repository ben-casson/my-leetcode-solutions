## Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed integer** array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a digit between `0` and `9` (**inclusive**).

The **triangular sum** of `nums` is the value of the only element present in `nums` after the following process terminates:

1. Let `nums` comprise of `n` elements. If `n == 1`, end the process. Otherwise, **create** a new **0-indexed** integer array `newNums` of length `n - 1`.
2. For each index `i`, where `0 <= i < n - 1`, **assign** the value of `newNums[i]` as `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`, where `%` denotes modulo operator.
3. **Replace** the array `nums` with `newNums`.
4. **Repeat** the entire process starting from step 1.

Return *the triangular sum of* `nums`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 9`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 8
Explanation:
The above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular sum of the array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Since there is only one element in nums, the triangular sum is the value of that element itself.
```

## Solution 1: Using Recursion

The recursive solution for this problem is relatively simple (assuming you are familiar with recursion). We begin by creating a base case, which will allow the function to eventually terminate. Our objective is to find the remaining number in an array after performing certain operations on previous 'parent' arrays. Thus, we can simply return the remaining element once our array's length is 1. 

With each recursive call, we create a new array `newNums`, the length of which will be equal to the function array argument's length minus one. We can then loop over `newNums` and set the current element `newNums[i]` equal to `(nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10` (which was given to us in the problem description). Finally, we return our function with `newNums` as its argument. This process will eventually give us an array with a single element. That element is the triangular sum of our original array `nums`. 

### **JavaScript**

```js
const triangularSum = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];

    let newNums = Array(nums.length - 1).fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < newNums.length; i++) {
        newNums[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10;
    }

    return triangularSum(newNums);
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `newNums`

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `newNums`

## Solution 2: Using 'while' Loop

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const triangularSum = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];

    let newNums;

    while (nums.length > 1) {
        newNums = Array(nums.length - 1).fill(0);
        for (let i = 0; i < newNums.length; i++) {
            newNums[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10;
        }
        nums = newNums;
    }

    return newNums[0];
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `newNums`

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `newNums`
