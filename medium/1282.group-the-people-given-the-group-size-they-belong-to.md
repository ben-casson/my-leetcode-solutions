## Problem Description

There are `n` people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a **unique ID** from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is the size of the group that person `i` is in. For example, if `groupSizes[1] = 3`, then person `1` must be in a group of size `3`.

Return *a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size `groupSizes[i]`*.

Each person should appear in **exactly one group**, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, **return any of them**. It is **guaranteed** that there will be **at least one** valid solution for the given input.

**Constraints:**

- `groupSizes.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
Output: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
Explanation: 
The first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
The second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
The third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
Output: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
```

## Solution

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const groupThePeople = function(groupSizes) {
    let largestGroupSize = 0;
    for (let size of groupSizes) {
        largestGroupSize = Math.max(largestGroupSize, size);
    }
    const groupCount = Array(largestGroupSize + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < groupSizes.length; i++) {
        groupCount[groupSizes[i]]++;
    }
    let output = [];
    for (let i = 1; i < groupCount.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < (groupCount[i] / i); j++) {
            output.push(new Array(i));
        }
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < output.length; i++) {
        if (output[i].includes(undefined)) {
            for (let k = 0; k < output[i].length; k++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < groupSizes.length; j++) {
                    if (groupSizes[j] != -1 && groupSizes[j] == output[i].length) {
                            if (output[i][k] == undefined) {
                                output[i][k] = j;
                                groupSizes[j] = -1;
                            }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return output;
};
