## Problem Description

There are `n` people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a **unique ID** from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is the size of the group that person `i` is in. For example, if `groupSizes[1] = 3`, then person `1` must be in a group of size `3`.

Return *a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size `groupSizes[i]`*.

Each person should appear in **exactly one group**, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, **return any of them**. It is **guaranteed** that there will be **at least one** valid solution for the given input.

**Constraints:**

- `groupSizes.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n`

**Example 1:**

**Example 2:**
