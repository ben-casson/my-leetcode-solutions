## Problem Description

You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer `k`. The `logs` are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each `logs[i] = [ID~i, time~i]` indicates that the user with `ID~i` performed an action at the minute `time~i`.

**Multiple users** can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform **multiple actions** in the same minute.

The **user active minutes (UAM)** for a given user is defined as the **number of unique minutes** in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a **1-indexed** array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (`1 <= j <= k`), `answer[j]` is the **number of users** whose **UAM** equals `j`.

Return *the array* `answer` *as described above*.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= logs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= ID~i <= 10^9`
- `1 <= time~i <= 10^5`
- `k` is in the range `[The maximum UAM for a user, 10^5]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).
The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.
The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.
Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.
```

## Solution

Explanation...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const findingUsersActiveMinutes = function(logs, k) {
    const usersMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0 ; i < logs.length; i++) {
        if (!usersMap.has(logs[i][0])) {
            usersMap.set(logs[i][0], new Set().add(logs[i][1]));
        }
        else {
            usersMap.get(logs[i][0]).add(logs[i][1]);
        }
    }
    const answer = new Array(k).fill(0);
    usersMap.forEach(user => answer[user.size - 1]++);
    return answer;
};
```
