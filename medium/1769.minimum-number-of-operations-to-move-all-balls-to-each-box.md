## Problem Description

You have `n` boxes. You are given a binary string `boxes` of length `n`, where `boxes[i]` is `'0'` if the `ith` box is **empty**, and `'1'` if it contains **one** ball.

In one operation, you can move **one** ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box `i` is adjacent to box `j` if `abs(i - j) == 1`. Note that after doing so, there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** number of operations needed to move all the balls to the `ith` box.

Each `answer[i]` is calculated considering the **initial** state of the boxes.

**Constraints:**

- `n == boxes.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2000`
- `boxes[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: boxes = "110"
Output: [1,1,3]
Explanation: The answer for each box is as follows:
1) First box: you will have to move one ball from the second box to the first box in one operation.
2) Second box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the second box in one operation.
3) Third box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the third box in two operations, and move one ball from the second box to the third box in one operation.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: boxes = "001011"
Output: [11,8,5,4,3,4]
```

## Solution 1: Brute Force

The brute force solution is relatively simple. First, we need to create an array called `answer`. `answer[i]` is  the **minimum** number of operations needed to move all the balls to the `ith` box. Next, we create an outer loop and a nested loop that both iterate over each element in `answer`. The absolute value of index `i` minus index `j` will give us the number of operations it takes to move a ball at index `j` to the `ith` position. If we do this everytime the character in `boxes` in the `jth` position is a `1` (meaning that box contains a ball) and add them to `answer[i]` then we get the total number of operations it takes to move all balls into the `ith` box. Finally, we return the `answer` array.

### **JavaScript**

```js
const minOperations = function(boxes) {
    const answer = Array(boxes.length).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < answer.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < answer.length; j++) {
            if (boxes.charAt(j) == '1') {
                answer[i] += Math.abs(i - j);   
            }
        }
    }
    return answer;
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `answer` array

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `answer` array

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int[] answer = new int[boxes.length()];
        for (int i = 0; i < boxes.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < boxes.length(); j++) {
                if (boxes.charAt(j) == '1') {
                    answer[i] += Math.abs(i - j);
                }
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `answer` array

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `answer` array

## Solution 2: Linear Time and Space

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const minOperations = function(boxes) {
    const answer = Array(boxes.length).fill(0);
    let ballCountRight = 0;
    let ballCountLeft = 0;
    let operationsRight = 0;    
    let operationsLeft = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < boxes.length; i++) {
        if (boxes.charAt(i) == '1') {
            ballCountRight++;
            operationsRight += i;
        }
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < answer.length; i++) {
        answer[i] = operationsLeft + operationsRight;
        operationsRight -= ballCountRight;
        if (boxes.charAt(i + 1) == '1') ballCountRight--;
        if (boxes.charAt(i) == '1') ballCountLeft++;
        operationsLeft += ballCountLeft;
    }
    return answer;
};
```
