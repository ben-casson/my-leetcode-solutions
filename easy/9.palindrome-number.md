## Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

- For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.

**Constraint:**

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Solution

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const isPalindrome = function(x) {
    let temp = 0;
    let temp2 = x;
    while (x > 0) {
        temp = (temp * 10) + (x % 10);
        x = Math.floor(x / 10);
    }
    return temp == temp2;
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements...

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements...

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int temp = 0;
        int temp2 = x;
        while (x > 0) {
            temp = (temp * 10) + (x % 10);
            x = (int) Math.floor(x / 10);
        }
        return temp == temp2;
    }
}
```
