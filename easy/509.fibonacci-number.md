## Problem Description

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,
```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```
Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 30`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

## Solution 1: Using `for` Loop

### **JavaScript**

```js
const fib = n => {
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) return n;
    let fibNum = 0;
    let first = 0;
    let second = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        fibNum = first + second;
        first = second;
        second = fibNum;
    }
    return fibNum;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the value of the given argument `n`

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
- No additional data structures needed

## Solution 2: Recursive One-liner

### **JavaScript**

```js
const fib = n => n === 0 || n === 1 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(2^N)$
- $N$ is the value of the given argument `n`

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
- No additional data structures needed
