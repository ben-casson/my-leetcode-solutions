## Problem Description

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the `length of the **last** word in the string`.

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
```

## Solution 1: Looping over `s`

We first create a variable called `lastWordLength` that represents the length of the last word. Then, we create a loop that starts at the end of `s` and works its way towards the first `' '` that has non-space characters after it. `lastWordLength` is incremented by one for each alphabetical character until the aforementioned `' '` is reached. That is when the loop is terminated. Finally, `lastWordLength` is returned.

### **JavaScript**

```js
const lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
    let lastWordLength = 0;
    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == ' ' && lastWordLength != 0) break;
        if (s.charAt(i) == ' ' && lastWordLength == 0) continue;
        lastWordLength++;
    }
    return lastWordLength;
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the sum of `lastWordLength` and the number of spaces at the end of `s`

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the value of `lastWordLength`

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int lastWordLength = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ' && lastWordLength != 0) break;
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ' && lastWordLength == 0) continue;
            lastWordLength++;
        }
        return lastWordLength;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the sum of `lastWordLength` and the number of spaces at the end of `s`

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the value of `lastWordLength`

## Solution 2: Using `trim()` and `lastIndexOf()`

This method uses less code, but also requires a bit more space since `trim()` creates a copy of `s`.

### **JavaScript**

```js
const lengthOfLastWord = s => s.trim().length - (s.trim().lastIndexOf(' ') + 1);
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of whitespace characters taken off using `trim()`

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of characters in `s`

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        return s.trim().length() - (s.trim().lastIndexOf(' ') + 1);
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of whitespace characters taken off using `trim()`

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of characters in `s`
