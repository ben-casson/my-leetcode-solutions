## Problem Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Solution

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const reverseString = function(s) {
    let length = s.length;
    for (let i = s.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        s.push(s[i]);
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < length - 1; i++) {
        s.shift();
    }
    return s;
};
```
