## Problem Description

A string is a **valid parentheses string** (denoted **VPS**) if it meets one of the following:

    It is an empty string `""`, or a single character not equal to `"("` or `")"`,
    It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are **VPS**'s, or
    It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a **VPS**.

We can similarly define the **nesting depth** `depth(S)` of any VPS `S` as follows:

- `depth("") = 0`
- `depth(C) = 0`, where `C` is a string with a single character not equal to `"("` or `")"`.
- `depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))`, where `A` and `B` are **VPS**'s.
- `depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A)`, where `A` is a **VPS**.

For example, `""`, `"()()"`, and `"()(()())"` are **VPS**'s (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and `")("` and `"(()"` are not **VPS**'s.

Given a **VPS** represented as string `s`, return *the **nesting depth** of* `s`.

**Constraints:**

- `CONSTRAINT`
- `CONSTRAINT`
- `CONSTRAINT`
