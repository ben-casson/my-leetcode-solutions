## Problem Description

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

**Merge** `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be *stored inside the array* `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

## Solution

If `nums1` only contains zeros then we set each of its elements to be equal to `nums2` elements at their respective indexes. 

If `nums1` *doesn't* contain only zeros then we loop over `nums1` and assign `nums2[j]`, j starting at `0` and incrementing by `1` each iteration, to `nums1[i]`. Finally, we sort `nums1` in ascending order.

### **JavaScript**

```js
const merge = function(nums1, m, nums2, n) {
    if (m == 0) {
        nums2.forEach((num, i) => nums1[i] = num);
    }
    let j = 0;
    for (let i = m; i < nums1.length; i++) {
        nums1[i] = nums2[j];
        j++;
    }
    nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(NlogN)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `nums1`

**Space Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `nums1`

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        if (m == 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
                nums1[i] = nums2[i]; 
            }
        }
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = m; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            nums1[i] = nums2[j];
            j++;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(NlogN)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `nums1`

**Space Complexity:** $O(logN)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in `nums1`
