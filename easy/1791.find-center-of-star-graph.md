## Problem Description

There is an undirected **star** graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one **center** node and **exactly** `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`. Return the center of the given star graph.

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= n <= 10^5`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- The given `edges` represent a valid star graph.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1
```

## Solution

Each nested array of the given array `edges` contains two things: a number that represents the center node and a number that represents a node connected only to the center node. Since the center node is in every nested array and no other nodes connect to each other, we can check which of the elements in the first nested array (`edges[0]`) is found in the second nested array (`edges[1]`). We return the recurring number, which is the value of the center node.

### **JavaScript**

```js
const findCenter = function(edges) {
    if (edges[1][0] === edges[0][0] || edges[1][1] === edges[0][0]) {
        return edges[0][0];
    }
    return edges[0][1];    
};
```
