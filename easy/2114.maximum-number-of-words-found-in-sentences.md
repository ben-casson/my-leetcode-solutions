## Problem Description

A **sentence** is a list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single **sentence**.

Return *the **maximum number of words** that appear in a single sentence*.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentences.length <= 100`
- `1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100`
- `sentences[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters and `' '` only.
- `sentences[i]` does not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `sentences[i]` are separated by a single space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
Output: 3
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.

## Solution 1: Brute Force

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const mostWordsFound = function(sentences) {
    let maxWordCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
        let currentWordCount = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < sentences[i].length; j++) {
            if (sentences[i][j] == ' ' || j == sentences[i].length - 1) {
                currentWordCount++;
            }
        }
        maxWordCount = Math.max(maxWordCount, currentWordCount);
    }
    return maxWordCount;    
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N\times M)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `sentences` array
- $M$ is the number of characters that make up the longest sentence

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
- time is constant since no new data structures are created

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {      
        int maxWordCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
            int currentWordCount = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < sentences[i].length(); j++) {
                if (Character.toString(sentences[i].charAt(j)).equals(" ") || (j == sentences[i].length() - 1)) {
                    currentWordCount++;                    
                }
            }
            maxWordCount = Math.max(currentWordCount, maxWordCount);
        }
        return maxWordCount;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N\times M)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `sentences` array
- $M$ is the number of characters that make up the longest sentence

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
- time is constant since no new data structures are created

## Solution 2: One-pass With $N$ New Arrays

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
const mostWordsFound = function(sentences) {
    return sentences.reduce((maxWordCount, currentSentence) => 
        Math.max(maxWordCount, currentSentence.split(" ").length), 0);
};
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `sentences` array

**Space Complexity:** $O(N\times M)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `sentences` array
- $M$ is the number of characters that make up the longest sentence

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int maxWordCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
            maxWordCount = Math.max(maxWordCount, sentences[i].split(" ").length);
        }
        return maxWordCount;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `sentences` array

**Space Complexity:** $O(N\times M)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `sentences` array
- $M$ is the number of characters that make up the longest sentence
