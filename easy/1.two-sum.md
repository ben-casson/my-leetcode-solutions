## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Follow-up:* Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

**Example 1:**
