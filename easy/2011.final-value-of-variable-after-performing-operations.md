## Problem Description

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:
- `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
- `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return *the **final** value of `X` after performing all the operations*.

**Constraints:**

- `CONSTRAINT`
- `CONSTRAINT`
- `CONSTRAINT`

**Example 1:**
