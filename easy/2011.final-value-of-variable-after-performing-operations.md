## Problem Description

There is a programming language with only **four** operations and **one** variable `X`:
- `++X` and `X++` **increments** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.
- `--X` and `X--` **decrements** the value of the variable `X` by `1`.

Initially, the value of `X` is `0`.

Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations, return *the **final** value of `X` after performing all the operations*.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
- `operations[i]` will be either `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, or `"X--"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
```

## Solution

EXPLANATION...

### **JavaScript**

```js
/**
 * @param {string[]} operations
 * @return {number}
 */
const finalValueAfterOperations = function(operations) {
    let X = 0;
    operations.forEach(operation => operation.charAt(1) === '+' ? X++ : X--);
    return X;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `operations` array

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
- Space complexity is constant since no new data structures were created

### **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int X = 0;
        for (String operation : operations) {
            char middleChar = operation.charAt(1);
            X += (Character.toString(middleChar).equals("+")) ? 1 : -1;
        }
        return X;
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
- $N$ is the number of elements in the `operations` array

**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
- Space complexity is constant since no new data structures were created
