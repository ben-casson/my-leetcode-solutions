## Problem Description

There are `n` seats and `n` students in a room. You are given an array `seats` of length `n`, where `seats[i]` is the position of the `ith` seat. You are also given the array `students` of length `n`, where `students[j]` is the position of the `jth` student.

You may perform the following move any number of times:

    Increase or decrease the position of the `ith` student by `1` (i.e., moving the `ith` student from position `x` to `x + 1` or `x - 1`)

Return the ***minimum number of moves** required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat*.

Note that there may be **multiple** seats or students in the **same** position at the beginning.
